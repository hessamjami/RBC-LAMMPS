# Optical Tweezer Analysis
This GitHub repository contains code and data for analyzing experimental optical tweezers results in the context of the Kelvin-Voigt phenomenological model. The focus of this analysis is on identifying a non-linear quadratic term that characterizes the behavior of the system.

Introduction
Optical tweezers are a powerful experimental technique used to manipulate and study the mechanical properties of individual biological cells, such as red blood cells (RBCs). In this project, we aim to understand the behavior of RBCs, particularly focusing on differentiating healthy RBCs from unhealthy ones.

Experimental Setup
The optical tweezer setup is used to trap and manipulate RBCs.
Experimental data is collected, including position and force measurements.
Kelvin-Voigt Phenomenological Model
The Kelvin-Voigt model is a linear viscoelastic model commonly used to describe the mechanical behavior of materials. In this analysis, we are interested in identifying non-linear terms within this model, specifically a quadratic term, which can provide insights into the mechanical properties of RBCs.

Data Analysis
The experimental data is processed and analyzed to identify the non-linear quadratic term.
Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is employed to study the correlation dimension of the data.
Results suggest that the underlying dynamics are consistent across RBC samples from healthy donors, while unhealthy RBCs exhibit distinct characteristics.
Repository Contents
Code: Contains Python scripts for data analysis and modeling.
Data: Includes the experimental data collected from optical tweezers.

Conclusion
The results from this analysis offer valuable insights into the mechanical properties of RBCs and their potential applications in distinguishing healthy and unhealthy RBCs. The identification of a non-linear quadratic term in the Kelvin-Voigt model opens up possibilities for further research and clinical applications.
